  HNu Photonics' Co-Founder and CEO, Daniel O'Connell, has been researching,
  designing, fabricating and field testing advanced optical imaging and spectral
  imaging systems since 1989. He is the co-inventor of 17 patents covering a
  vast array of optical technologies, including the medical imaging
  breakthrough, CellTray. The CellTray technology was initially funded under an
  NSF SBIR grant and became the basis for Nanopoint.

<p>
  In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, HNu Photonics applied their technical
  and manufacturing expertise to build emergency bridge ventilators for
  hospitals in Hawaii and around the world. Within 45 days the company began
  delivering ventilators and is prepared to ramp production to 1,000 units per
  week as needed to meet demand.

<div class="arc-subhead">Financial Plan</div>

<img src="/img/cases/hnu-5.jpg" alt="" class="img-r" />
<p>
  HNu Photonics was created and has been able to grow to date entirely without
  raising outside equity capital. Leveraging the technical expertise and proven
  record of success of its founders, HNu was able to win key contracts at
  inception. By performing on those contracts and exercising careful financial
  management, HNu built its capital base the old-fashioned way – by earning it.
</p>

<img src="/img/cases/hnu-6.jpg" alt="" class="img-l" />
<p>
  HNu's technologies address the needs of customers across scientific, military,
  and commercial sectors, so HNu operates under a diversified portfolio of
  contracts yielding predictable future revenue. American Research Capital (ARC)
  can look to this flow of income along with HNu's record of success to finance
  the capital investment required for projects and opportunities that are not
  immediately self-funding. ARC gives HNu the flexibility to accelerate the pace
  of development, take on larger orders, and grow its business more quickly
  without the dilution and distraction of outside investors. ARC allows HNu’s
  founders to keep their focus on their customers, their markets, and their
  technologies, not their &quot;exit strategy.&quot;
