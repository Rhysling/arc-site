  Incorporated in 2006 and based on Maui, Hawaii, HNu Photonics is a science and
  technology company creating cutting-edge technologies and transforming
  innovative ideas into state-of-the-art products with commercial, scientific
  and military applications. The focus of the company is renewable energy,
  defense photonics, specialized optics, and medical imaging technologies. HNu
  has already introduced revolutionary advances in each of these areas,
  including major breakthroughs in solar energy generation with previously
  unseen advances in efficiency and practicality.

<p>
  HNu Photonics has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the military,
  having placed in service a number of successful technologies. Current projects
  with military applications include multi-dimensional sensor technology
  utilizing 3D imaging, spectrometer design and development, laser beam control
  interfacing and the development of beam projectors and receivers.

<p>
  HNu Photonics is organized as a vertically-integrated research, design,
  fabrication, testing and marketing operation which enables HNu to nurture
  technological innovations from concept to final product. HNu’s expertise and
  capabilities with broad applications across various domains of investigation,
  design and fabrication are the keys to its successes.

  HNu Photonics' Co-Founder and CEO, Daniel O'Connell, has been researching,
  designing, fabricating and field testing advanced optical imaging and spectral
  imaging systems since 1989. He is the co-inventor of 17 patents covering a
  vast array of optical technologies, including the medical imaging
  breakthrough, CellTray. The CellTray technology was initially funded under an
  NSF SBIR grant and became the basis for Nanopoint.

<img src="/img/cases/hnu-5.jpg" alt="" class="img-r" />
<p>
  HNu Photonics was created and has been able to grow to date entirely without
  raising outside equity capital. Leveraging the technical expertise and proven
  record of success of its founders, HNu was able to win key contracts at
  inception. By performing on those contracts and exercising careful financial
  management, HNu built its capital base the old fashioned way – by earning it.
</p>

<p>
  HNu's technologies address the needs of customers across scientific, military
  and commercial sectors, so HNu operates under a diversified portfolio of
  contracts yielding predictable future revenue. American Research Capital (ARC)
  is able to look to this flow of income along with HNu’s record of success to
  finance the capital investment required for projects and opportunities that
  are not immediately self-funding. ARC gives HNu the flexibility to accelerate
  the pace of development, take on larger orders, and grow its business more
  quickly without the dilution and distraction of outside investors. ARC allows
  HNu’s founders to keep their focus on their customers, their markets, and
  their technologies, not their &quot;exit strategy.&quot;
