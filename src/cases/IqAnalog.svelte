<p>IQ-Analog is a fabless ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) company whose proprietary ADC (analog to digital conversion) and
DAC (digital to analog conversion) technology reduces chip area and power consumption by a factor of four or more relative to state-of-the-art
commercial components provided by vendors such as Xilinx, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, and Broadcom.</p>

<p>Formed in 2004 by a former engineering director at Broadcom, IQ-Analog is comprised of industry veterans with heritage from major U.S. chip suppliers.
The company is 80% employee owned and offers a 100% U.S. based design team with no international dependencies and top secret clearance access.
Customers include DARPA, Lockheed Martin, NXP, Broadcom, and others.</p>

<p>The companyâ€™s focus since inception has been to look beyond the state of the art in high speed data converter technology.  Research and development
has been funded primarily through IP licensing of derivative data converter core technologies and funding from DARPA.  The company holds 31 patents
including 22 issued US patents protecting its unique product technology.</p>

<p>IQ-Analog is the sole source of digital antenna processors for the defense / aerospace market servicing next generation radar, communications,
and electronic warfare. The company has applied its revolutionary, patent-protected technology to the first wave of 5G wireless infrastructure
and is partnering with industry leaders to deliver the next wave of processors with embedded data conversion.  IQ-Analog data conversion systems
leverage TPWQ that operate with 8X faster cores and offer 4X lower power with 14X smaller die area. Since the build cost of semiconductors is
proportional to die area, this area savings converts directly to an overall 93% cost savings.</p>
